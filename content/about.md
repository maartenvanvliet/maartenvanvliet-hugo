## Software Consultant

Specialized in Agile development in Ruby. Eloquent in languages such as PHP/Elixir/R/Javascript/Python and others.

As a consultant I advice clients in the development of software and help out in the implementation. I have extensive knowledge of web technologies and know my way around data. 

I work in the Netherlands but am also available to work remotely anywhere else I can work independently but also in a team and deliver clean and legible code.

Contact me if you're interested.
